This is a guide to build a service that will hook into the Bing public search engine.

Step 1: Basic Service Setup
- Create a basic C++ project structure:
-- Set up a C++ project using GNU C++ 17.
-- Include necessary libraries such as libcurl.

Step 2: API Implementation
- Implement the API:
-- Create endpoints that support GET and POST protocols over HTTPS.
-- Ensure all requests are logged.

Step 3: Adhere to SOLID Principles
- Refactor the code:
-- Ensure the code follows SOLID principles.

Step 4: Indexing Internal Content
- Support indexing internal content:
-- Implement functionality to index internal content.

Step 5: Dispatch Logic
- Implement dispatch logic:
-- Create logic to route queries to either Bing or an internal indexer, depending on the query type.

Step 6: Concurrency
- Handle concurrency:
-- Use threads to handle different tasks concurrently.

Step 7: Error Handling
- Proper handling of errors and exceptions:
-- Implement error and exception handling mechanisms.

Step 8: Integration and Testing
- Integrate and test the service:
-- Ensure all components work together seamlessly.
-- Write unit tests to verify the functionality.
