@workspace I need to create a short document for the 'company-library' project. Include the following sections: 'Introduction', 'Installation', 'Usage', 'Contributing', 'License'. 

@workspace I need a technical report describing the 'company-library' project. Include an comprehensive description of all classes.

@workspace can you recommend improvements of the  'company-library' project? My particular concern is adherence to best practices and design patterns.

@workspace Recommend a table design to match the employee class hierarchy in the  'company-library' project folder. Use T-SQL to create the tables.

@workspace show me T-SQL commands to create an 'Employees' table with a one-to-one relationship to a 'Developer' table and a one-to-one relationship to a 'Manager' table. The tables should model the classes: 'Employee' , 'Developer', 'Manager' in the  'company-library'project.

@workspace in the 'react-samples' subfolder is a 'ReactJS' app with 'Jest' testing framework. I would like to recreate this app in Python. Please provide instructions with code. I want to use 'Pytest' as the testing framework, and 'React' as the front-end framework.  The 'reacts-samples/src/client' folder contains the 'React' app with tests and the 'src/server' folder contains the server code.
